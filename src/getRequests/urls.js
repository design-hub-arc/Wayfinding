/*
HOW TO CHANGE THE mapURL FILE:
    Can't do yet, unless the map shows the same section of campus as the current one.
	1. Put a .png file into google drive.
	2. copy that image's URL using "get sharable link"
	3. paste the URL after var mapURL = ... in place of the existing URL
	4. make sure there are quote marks around the URL (can be double or single quotes)
	5. replace the "open" in the URL with "uc"
	6. ???
